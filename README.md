# planning-my-day

This assignment called for the use of HTML, CSS and jQuery to generate a simple day planner. 

I started by building a row of static HTML elements with headers for each column. I then worked on the JavaScript to inject a series of rows to give time blocks from 9 am to 5 pm. 

I also used moment.JS to place the current time into the header. 

Finally, I tweaked the color scheme to feature mostly green, white and gray. 

## Trouble spots
I was unable to complete several aspects of the assignment, though I did try to pseudo-code it. 

I couldn't crack local storage for a second straight week. This has been one of my biggest stumbling blocks in the first six weeks of bootcamp. 

I also wasn't able to take the time data and change the colors of the event blocks to reflect whether it was past, present or future.
